# HalfStepper Library for Arduino

Allows Arduino boards to control a 4 wire stepper motor with higher precision and smoother control.

This library allows you to control bipolar stepper motors. To use it you will need a stepper motor, and the appropriate hardware to control it. This is a modification of the current Stepper library for 4 wire steppers, adding the signaling for half stepping.
